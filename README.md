# AI-Capstone-Project
A beginner-friendly toolkit that helps get started with Python 
# Title & Objective
Technology Chosen: Python
# Why Python?
- Beginner-friendly syntax that reads like English
- Massive community and extensive libraries
- Versatile (web development, data science, AI, automation)
- High demand in job market
- Excellent for learning programming fundamentals
# End Goal:
Create a simple code that demonstrates Python fundamentals including variables, functions, loops, and user input.
# Quick Summary of Python
# What is it?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simple syntax and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, it emphasizes code readability and allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.
# Where is it used?
Data Science & Machine Learning (TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy)
Web Development (Django, Flask)
Automation & Scripting
Scientific Computing
Artificial Intelligence
Game Development
# Real-world example:
Instagram's backend is built with Python, Netflix uses Python for their recommendation algorithms, and NASA uses Python for space mission analysis and data processing.
# System RequirementsOS: Windows 10/11 (also works on macOS/Linux)
# Tools Required:Python 3.8+ (Official Python interpreter)
# Text Editor/IDE: VS Code, PyCharm Community, or IDLE (comes with Python)
# Command Line/Terminal: Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell
# Packages: pip (Python package installer - comes with Python 3.4+)
# Installation & Setup InstructionsStep 1: 
Install Python
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
Download the latest Python 3.x version for Windows
IMPORTANT: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
Click "Install Now"
Verify installation: Open Command Prompt and type:
bashpython --version``
Expected output: Python 3.x.x

# Install VS Code (Recommended)
Download VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
Install and launch VS Code
Install Python extension:
